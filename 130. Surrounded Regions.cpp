// ***
//
// Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
//
// A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
//
// Example:
// X X X X
// X O O X
// X X O X
// X O X X
//
// After running your function, the board should be:
// X X X X
// X X X X
// X X X X
// X O X X
//
// Explanation:
// Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to
// 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two
// cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
//
// ***
//
// First traverse the four edges for 'O', DFS the 'O's and change all 'O' to '$'.
// Now, all 'O' left (those that have not been dfs-ed) must have been surrounded by 'X'. Change all of them to 'X'.
// Then, change the '$'s back to 'O'.
