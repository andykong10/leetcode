// According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life,
// is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."
//
// Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0).
// Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken
// from the above Wikipedia article):
//
// Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
// Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
// Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
// Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
//
// Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state.
// The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births
// and deaths occur simultaneously.
//
// Example:
//
// Input:
// [
//   [0,1,0],
//   [0,0,1],
//   [1,1,1],
//   [0,0,0]
// ]
//
// Output:
// [
//   [0,0,0],
//   [1,0,1],
//   [0,1,1],
//   [0,1,0]
// ]

            // live is the total lives (including self (the center cell)) we have in a 3 by 3 window.
            // Because board[x][y] is binary, we can sum all board[x][y] bitwise & 0b00000001
            // in this 3 by 3 window to get the total number of live cells.
            //
            // The right most bit is the current state of board[x][y];
            // The second right most bit is the next state of board[x][y].
            //
            // Why do you need to bitwise &?
            // Because the current state of board[x][y] is stored at the right most bit, i.e. 0b00000001 or 0b00000000
            // (1 or 0), but the next state of board[x][y] is stored at the second right most bit! i.e. 0b00000011 or
            // 0b00000010 (3 or 2), So to get the total *current* lives in a 3 by 3 window you should only look at the
            // right most bit. You can't just do lives += board[x][y], this doesn't make sense (board[x][y] could be 3
            // or 4)
            //
            // The max and min here are very smart:
            // We do it so that we can check the entire grid and not worrying about out of bound problem

            // Well, you can just write the four rules explicitly.
            // We store whether board[i][j] is live using bitwise | with 0b00000010 and store the status in the second
            // right most bit. After we've processed all cells, we right shift every board[i][j] to get its current
            // status
