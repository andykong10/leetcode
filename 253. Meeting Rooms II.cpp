//
// Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei), find the
// minimum number of conference rooms required.
//
// Example 1:
// Input: [[0, 30],[5, 10],[15, 20]]
// Output: 2

// Example 2:
// Input: [[7, 10],[2, 4]]
// Output: 1

// one room. If start time and end time overlap, the net room change is zero. timeToNewRoomsNeeded[i] is additional room
// you need at time i (can also be negative, which means you've vacated rooms). In the end, traverse through all the
// time (i.e. whenever you start or end a meeting), clculate how many rooms you need to use at each time, and keep track

    // the end time for your new meeting in (pq size -1 (pop), then +1 (push)). However when you do not have a vancated
    // room to use, you only push the end time for your new meeting in without poping any end time out (pq size +1
    // (push)). So in the end the size of pq tracks the total number of meeting rooms you have opened when you've
    // finished traversing all the meetings.
