// ***
//
// Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k),
// where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater
// than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.
//
// Note:
// The number of people is less than 1,100.
//
// Example
//
// Input:
// [[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]
//
// Output:
// [[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
//
// ***
//
// Sort by height (taller person to the left, shorter person to the right)
// When two people have the same height, the person with less people in front of him takes precedence over the person
// with more people in front.
//
// Original: [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
// After sorted: [[7,0],[7,1],[6,1],[5,0],[5,2],[4,4]]
// Return: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
